We\\nopenly release the collected data, data cura-\\ntion procedure, training code, and final model\\nweights to promote open research and repro-\\nducibility. Additionally, we release quantized\\n4-bit versions of the model allowing virtually\\nanyone to run the model on CPU.\\n1 Data Collection and Curation\\nWe collected roughly one million prompt-\\nresponse pairs using the GPT-3.5-Turbo OpenAI\\nAPI between March 20, 2023 and March 26th,\\n2023. To do this, we first gathered a diverse sam-\\nple of questions/prompts by leveraging three pub-\\nlicly available datasets:\\n• The unified chip2 subset of LAION OIG.\\n• Coding questions with a random sub-sample\\nof Stackoverflow Questions\\n• Instruction-tuning with a sub-sample of Big-\\nscience/P3\\nWe chose to dedicate substantial attention to data\\npreparation and curation based on commentary in\\nthe Stanford Alpaca project (Taori et al., 2023).\\nUpon collection of the initial dataset of prompt-\\ngeneration pairs, we loaded data into Atlas for data\\ncuration and cleaning. With Atlas, we removed all\\nexamples where GPT-3.5-Turbo failed to respond\\nto prompts and produced malformed output. This\\nreduced our total number of examples to 806,199\\nhigh-quality prompt-generation pairs. Next, we\\ndecided to remove the entire Bigscience/P3 sub-\\nset from the final training dataset due to its very\\nFigure 1: TSNE visualization of the candidate training\\ndata (Red: Stackoverflow, Orange: chip2, Blue: P3).\\nThe large blue balls (e.g. indicated by the red arrow)\\nare highly homogeneous prompt-response pairs.\\nlow output diversity; P3 contains many homoge-\\nneous prompts which produce short and homoge-\\nneous responses from GPT-3.5-Turbo. This exclu-\\nsion produces a final subset containing 437,605\\nprompt-generation pairs, which is visualized in\\nFigure 2. You can interactively explore the dataset\\nat each stage of cleaning at the following links:\\n• Cleaned with P3\\n• Cleaned without P3 (Final Training Dataset)\\n2 Model Training\\nWe train several models finetuned from an in-\\nstance of LLaMA 7B (Touvron et al., 2023).\\nThe model associated with our initial public re-\\nlease is trained with LoRA (Hu et al., 2021)\\non the 437,605 post-processed examples for four\\nepochs. Detailed model hyper-parameters and\\ntraining code can be found in the associated repos-\\nitory and model training log.(a) TSNE visualization of the final training data, ten-colored\\nby extracted topic.\\n(b) Zoomed in view of Figure 2a. The region displayed con-\\ntains generations related to personal health and wellness.\\nFigure 2: The final training data was curated to ensure a diverse distribution of prompt topics and model responses.\\n2.1 Reproducibility\\nWe release all data (including unused P3 genera-\\ntions), training code, and model weights for the\\ncommunity to build upon. Please check the Git\\nrepository for the most up-to-date data, training\\ndetails and checkpoints.\\n2.2 Costs\\nWe were able to produce these models with about\\nfour days work, $800 in GPU costs (rented from\\nLambda Labs and Paperspace) including several\\nfailed trains, and $500 in OpenAI API spend.\\nOur released model, gpt4all-lora, can be trained in\\nabout eight hours on a Lambda Labs DGX A100\\n8x 80GB for a total cost of $100 .\\n3 Evaluation\\nWe perform a preliminary evaluation of our model\\nusing the human evaluation data from the Self-\\nInstruct paper (Wang et al., 2022). We report the\\nground truth perplexity of our model against what\\nis, to our knowledge, the best openly available\\nalpaca-lora model, provided by user chainyo on\\nhuggingface. We find that all models have very\\nlarge perplexities on a small number of tasks, and\\nreport perplexities clipped to a maximum of 100.\\nModels finetuned on this collected dataset ex-\\nhibit much lower perplexity in the Self-Instruct\\nevaluation compared to Alpaca. This evaluation is\\nin no way exhaustive and further evaluation work\\nFigure 3: Model Perplexities. Lower is better. Our\\nmodels achieve stochastically lower ground truth per-\\nplexities than alpaca-lora.\\nremains. We welcome the reader to run the model\\nlocally on CPU (see Github for files) and get a\\nqualitative sense of what it can do.\\n4 Use Considerations\\nThe authors release data and training details in\\nhopes that it will accelerate open LLM research,\\nparticularly in the domains of alignment and inter-\\npretability.
